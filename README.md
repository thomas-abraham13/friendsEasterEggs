# Friends Easter Eggs on Google:
The main purpose of this project was to gain a basic understanding of puppeteer from an automation perspective.

- The aim of this project was to automate the process of seraching for the individual cast of the sit-com Friends(1994) on Google and then displaying the easter eggs related to each one of them.
- The .js scripts are all identical and use puppeteer which is a high-level API to control Chrome/Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs in headless mode by default, but can be configured to run in full ("headful") Chrome/Chromium.

## Execution:
Clone the repo and run the following command in the `main` folder:
`node <name>.js`

e.g. `node joey.js`
